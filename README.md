# Readit
Reddit-style PHP content aggregation site

## Design philosophy
Readit is intended to be an easy-to-install web application that is accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of installing and maintaining PHP websites.  Installation should not be any more complicated then setting the files in a web server, creating a database and running an installation script.
